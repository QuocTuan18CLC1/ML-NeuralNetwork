# Objectives: Applying an artificial neural network to real-world tasks

# Abstract: 
- [ ] Implementing an artificial neural network, either traditional networks or deep networks, for object classification on some prepared datasets
- [ ] Dataset available in this project: 
  + 1. The MNIST dataset of handwritten digits: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
  + 2. The EMNIST dataset of handwritten characters and digits: https://www.nist.gov/itl/products-and-services/emnist-dataset
  + 3. The Fashion-MNIST dataset of Zalando's article images (clothes, bags, shoes,etc.): https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist
  + 4. The Kaggle dataset of cats and dogs: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats
- [ ] Neural networks available to implement:
  + Traditional neural networks: Perceptron, MLP, SOM, RNN, etc 
  + Simple convolutional neural networks: LeNet and its variants, AlexNet, etc.
  + Advanced convolution neural networks/deep neural networks: those with more sophisticated architectures
- [ ] Libraries, resources:
  + You can use any libraries that you are most familiar with (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.)
  + You also may consult any papers, books, online references, or publicly available implementations for ideas and code that you may want to incorporate into your project, so long as you clearly cite your sources in your code and your writeup.
  
# Requirements:
- [ ] Implement an artificial neural network, either traditional networks or deep networks, for object classification.
- [ ] You can choose one (or more) of the listed data sets and an suggested appropriate neural network architecture described in the abstract to fulfill the above requirements.
- [ ] Show your understandings on the analysis of experimental results. The experimental results should include tables and figures demonstrating the training loss, accuracies, successful and/or failure cases.
- [ ] Examine the effects of hyperparameters and parameters of the neural network in consideration to its performance and accuracy.
